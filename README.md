Event Knowledge Report is a Python-based NLP project developed by japro-git that uses spaCy to extract valuable insights from event descriptions. It performs extractive summarization to generate concise summaries, applies Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify people, organizations, dates, and locations, and produces structured data to create knowledge-style event reports. The project demonstrates natural language understanding using spaCy’s en_core_web_sm model and Python’s built-in libraries such as collections.Counter. By running the main script (event_report.py), users can analyze event texts, view key entities, and understand the summarized context automatically. The repository includes a simple folder structure with requirements.txt for dependencies and sample event data for testing.
